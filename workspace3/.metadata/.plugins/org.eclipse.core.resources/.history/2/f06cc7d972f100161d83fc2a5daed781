Assignment 2

The files associated with Assignment 2 are on this repo.

Directories: The only subdirectories are /src, /bin, and /WebContent.

Please follow comments in the code to see thought processes and the mechanics of each function.

Beginning from inputFileEntry.jsp, the user can go through the Cinemate site by interacting with clickable and typeable input components. JAVA Servlets on the back-end do basic authentication for login functionality and provide results for search functionality. The database that Cinemate works from is provided by the user. 

**input file: The sample input I was using for DB was input_file.txt, located in the  /src folder. Since transitioning functionality from Assignment1 to Assignment2, the input file can't be found just in the project directory.**

Error checking: DOMParser.java now implements a function 'check()' that returns a string. If the string provides the okay, the user advances on to the login page. Else, the string provides an error the user is stuck on the input file page until the input file is fixed. 

DOMParser.java: 
XML-Parser that places XML info into Java simple variables and artificial objects like Movie, User, etc. 

SocialMedia.java: 
Remnant of Assignment1, providing a model sequence of the user experience in Cinemate. 

If there are any questions or concerns about running or configuration, please contact dkawalsk@usc.edu :)
