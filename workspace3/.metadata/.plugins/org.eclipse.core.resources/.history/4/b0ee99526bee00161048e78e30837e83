RequestDispatcher.forward() vs HttpServletResponse.sendRedirect()

RequestDispatcher.forward()
- when we redirect using forward and we want to use same data in new resource
- we can use request.setAttribute() as we have request object available.

HttpServletResponse.sendRedirect()
- we'd have to store data in session or pass along with url
- not transparent
- transfer to another resource or to a different domain or differeent server for "further processing"
